    "bodyTopHome2": "I am a seeker, curious, attentive and dreamer. In my search process through self-knowledge, I discovered, in the mandalas, a path to express my creative ability. They brought me healing, from  psychological, emotional and even physical issues, because everything, after all, is energy and mandalas as sacred symbols, are energy portals.",

    "serviceContent": "Receive your multidimensional portal in your home. Custom mandalas are exclusive items made based on a one-hour conversation with you, where we will get to know each other so that I can understand your energy. I will understand what you are feeling, living, what you want to attract. It is a process of anamnesis, where not always the colors you like the most will be the most suitable for the moment you are experiencing.",
    "serviceSubContent": "So this conversation helps guide my intuition to materialize your dimensional portal using Sacred Geometry, the power of numbers, shapes and colors. You will receive, in addition to the mandala, a complete description of its energies, a report with the numerology of your name and date of birth, as well as an indication of which spaces in the house are best suited to place your energy portal based on Feng Shui.",

In a consultation we will talk about the moment lived and find alternatives to help in the dissolution of problems and traumas. If you already draw mandalas, I will read and interpret your mandalas as long as they have been made by you for yourself. From this reading, I indicate what kind of shapes, colors and practices need to be incorporated to balance the energies, in case they are unbalanced, and take advice on how to deal with the situation experienced.",
    "serviceConsultSubContent": "If you already draw by order, or to give as gifts to people, this is an opportunity to value your art, because I provide an in-depth description of the mandala's energies, taking into account the colors, shapes, geometries, numbers and their arrangement in the mandala. I use knowledge of numerology, sacred geometry, Yin and Yang and Feng Shui to build a complete report for you! With this report, you can send along with the mandala a description of the energies it manifests, making a personal interpretation of how that report dialogues with the life of the person for whom the mandala is intended. This report will be a guide, but your intuition, in the end, does the most work!",
